DESCRIPTION
   Ever wondered how many lines of code or how many classes there
   are in the Sun JDK? Curious about the size of your own 
   projects - or do you want to keep track of your work-progress.
   That's what JavaNCSS is for.

   JavaNCSS is a simple command line utility which measures two
   standard source code metrics for the Java programming
   language. The metrics are collected globally, for each class
   and/or for each function.

FEATURES
   - Metrics can be applied to global-, class-, or function-level.
   - Non Commenting Source Statements (NCSS).
   - Cyclomatic Complexity Number (McCabe metric).
   - Packages, classes, functions and inner classes are counted.
   - Number of formal Javadoc comments per class and method.
   - Average values are calculated.
   - Command line driven.
   - A GUI is provided for better output browsing as well as the
     integration of JavaNCSS in a project manager and class
     browser named Jacob (http://www.kclee.de/clemens/jacob/) for
     easy selection of input source files.
   - XML output (optional).
   - XSLT stylesheets provided for further generation of HTML, 
     and SVG reports and as a basis for your own custom 
     reports.
   - Ant task (written by Steve Jernigan).
   - Support for Java 1.5 syntax (generics, enums, etc.).
   - Support for Java 1.7 syntax (try with resource, literals, etc.).
   - 100% Pure Java.
   - Free software (GNU LGPL).
