A Source Measurement Suite for Java

DESCRIPTION
   Ever wondered how many lines of code or how many classes there
   are in the Sun JDK? Curious about the size of your own 
   projects - or do you want to keep track of your work-progress.
   That's what JavaNCSS is for.

   JavaNCSS is a simple command line utility which measures two
   standard source code metrics for the Java programming
   language. The metrics are collected globally, for each class
   and/or for each function.

FEATURES
   - Metrics can be applied to global-, class-, or function-level.
   - Non Commenting Source Statements (NCSS).
   - Cyclomatic Complexity Number (McCabe metric).
   - Packages, classes, functions and inner classes are counted.
   - Number of formal Javadoc comments per class and method.
   - Average values are calculated.
   - Command line driven.
   - A GUI is provided for better output browsing as well as the
     integration of JavaNCSS in a project manager and class
     browser named Jacob (http://www.kclee.com/clemens/jacob/) for
     easy selection of input source files.
   - XML output (optional).
   - XSLT stylesheets provided for further generation of HTML, 
     and SVG reports and as a basis for your own custom 
     reports.
   - Ant task (written by Steve Jernigan).
   - 100% Pure Java.
   - Free software (GNU GPL).
