JavaNCSS Development Details

  JavaNCSS has been moved on August 2008 to Codehaus for a {{{source-repository.html}shared source code repository}}.
  There is also a {{{issue-tracking.html}bug tracking}} tool.

  JavaNCSS can actually be built using Ant (<<<ant all>>>) or Maven (<<<mvn package>>>).
